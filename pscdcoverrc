# vim: set ft=conf :
#
# This is a sample configuration file for pscdcover(1). Copy it to
# ~/.pscdcoverrc and edit it to meet your requirements.
#
# Configuration lines consist of a key and a value, separated by an equal sign
# (=). Whitespace at the beginning or end of the line, or on either side of the
# equal sign, is ignored. The key names should correspond to a valid
# command-line option to pscdcover(1).
#
# Comments start with a hash sign (#) or a colon (;). The colon-comments are
# used to indicate a default value, whereas hash-comments denote embedded
# documentation.

# ps
# Specifies the path to the PostScript template.
; ps = /usr/local/share/pscdcover/pscdcover.ps

# title
# Provides a title for the CD. The title will be printed on top of the first
# page, and on the sides of the back label. If this option is omitted, it
# defaults to the value of the root parameter, or its default value.

# root
# Specifies the mount point of the CD-ROM.
; root = /media/cdrom

# files
# When set, the regular files are also printed, not just the directories.
; files = 0

# mp3
# When set, MP3 files will be checked for an ID3 tag. The title of the song
# together with its length will be printed out instead of the filename. This
# implies files=1. You must have the MP3::Info Perl module installed to use
# this option.
; mp3 = 0

# depth
# When omitted or set to 0, the program traverses the CD-ROM as deep as
# possible.  This option allows for limiting the depth of the search. A value
# of 1 will only ouput the top-level directories, i.e., those just below the
# directory specified by the root parameter.
; depth = 0
depth = 2

# box
# When set, the edges of the labels are drawn in dim gray.
; box = 1

# separator
# When set, prints a line as column separator.
; separator = 0

# all
# Forces the printing of all the pages (front and back), even if the whole
# directory tree could be printed on only the first page.
; all = 0

# columns
# Specifies the number of columns to print on each page. When set to 0, the
# column widths will be calculated dynamically, so that the longest filename in
# each column fits.
; columns = 2

# minwidth
# Specifies the minimum allowed width for a column (in millimeters). If the
# room left on the right side of the page is lower than this limit, the next
# column will be printed on the next page, otherwise its content will be
# clipped to the current page. This option is only relevant with columns = 0.
; minwidth = 25

# color
# Generate color output: the CD and folder icons will be drawn in colors, light
# blue and light yellow respectively. These default colors can be overridden
# with the cd-color and folder-color parameters.
; color = 0

# cd-color and folder-color
# Override the default color for the CD and folder icons respectively. The
# value should be an hexadecimal triplet representing the shares of red, green
# and blue in the desired color, like those commonly found in HTML or CSS. The
# value may optionally be prefixed with 0x, the traditional C prefix for
# hexadecimal.  Three-digits triplets will be doubled (e.g., 0xC30 is the same
# as CC3300).  Specifying at least one of these options implies color = 1.
; cd-color     = 0xccd8e5
; folder-color = 0xffff80
