PostScript::CDCover module - create postscript for print a CD cover based on
CD-ROM directory tree.
============================================================

The PostScript::CDCover module currently ships with a script that uses this
module: pscdcover, which should be installed in a directory in your $PATH,
along with its own manual page.

pscdcover can make use of a configuration file, either /etc/pscdcoverrc or
~/.pscdcoverrc. An example of such a file can be found in the source
distribution of PostScript::CDCover.

pscdcover supports a --mp3 command-line switch which enables it to print the
song name instead of the file name when it encounters an MP3 file. To do so it
needs the MP3::Info module to installed as well. Since one might want to use
PostScript::CDCover for something else than MP3 files on CD, MP3::Info has not
been included in the module's dependancies, so it will not be automatically
installed by CPAN when you install PostScript::CDCover: you'll have to do it
explicitely.

Thank you for using PostScript::CDCover.
